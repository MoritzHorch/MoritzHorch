### ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I am a Fullstack Software Engineer and Architect and live nearby Karlsruhe, Germany.

### ðŸ’¬ About me

I have been interested in technology since I was a child. Be it small tinkering for video games, 
but also the first self-built PC.

I am still fascinated by the diversity of this environment, even though I am more inclined 
towards classic software development and consulting. In addition, I have built my own smart home,
through which I always learn something new outside the world of web development.

### ðŸ”­ Expertise

Primarly building applications using

 - Java / Kotlin with Spring Boot
 - JS / TS with React
 - DevSecOps practises
